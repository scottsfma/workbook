      <h2>Processing p5.js creative coding</h2>

      <p>
        <br>
        This week we started to learn about creative coding using Processing p5.js. We learned how to create shapes, lines, and colors using code techniques. My favorite one is the circle that forms and trail and follows the cursor because it reminds me of the sandworm from "Dune". We also learned how to use the setup() and draw() functions to create interactive graphics. We also came up with algorithms using dices and drew the outcome on tracing paper. Although it can be a bit too complex sometimes I still find it fascinating to see the result.
