        <b>Website Mk1</b>
        <br />
        At first I don't exactly know what I was doing and Kind of just used the
        very limited code I learned in class to build this website. It's very
        simple.

      <p>
        <br />
        <b>Website MK2</b>
        <br />
        I have started to learn more about CSS and HTML and started to make the
        website look better. I have also added a navigation bar and a footer. I
        try to incorporate my initial idea to create a secret file/ consipiracy
        board and made it the theme for my index page.

      <h2>Week 4 ~ Present</h2>

      <p>
        <br />
        <b>Website MK3</b>
        <br />
        I have adjust several things regarding the website based on the feedback
        from Project 2A. I have swapped out the sticky notes with classified
        files to avoid the website feeling like a classroom and steering to far
        away from the secret spy vibes. I have added a new page for the website
        progress, a working hamburger menu, a marquee at the homepage, and some
        layout changes to the website itself.
