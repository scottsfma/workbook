          <b>"PomPom Mirror" by Daniel Rozin</b>
          <br>
          Daniel Rozin is known for his interactive mirror installations. This mirror uses PomPom to create a reflection of the viewer.

          <b>"Faces" by Arturo Castro</b>
          <br>
          This project uses face detection and tracking algorithms to replace the faces in a live webcam feed with other faces sourced from images or videos. The result is a surreal and sometimes uncanny effect where the viewer's face is seamlessly replaced by faces from various sources.

      <h2>p5 creative coding during tutorial</h2>
      <p>
        This week in class we experiment with more creative coding techniques using p5.js and processing. My favorite among the things we tried are the picture trails one and the dot-linking one. I took a picture of my fish to make the a winding trail on the canvas. I also did an angel by linking the dots.
